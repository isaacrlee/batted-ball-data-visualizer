to create plots for batters, pitchers, and batter pitcher matchups ![Example Batted Ball Plots](https://github.com/isaacrlee/batted-ball-data-visualizer/raw/master/ScreenShot.png "Example Batted Ball Plots")

Powered by Bootstrap, Algolia, plotly.js, and Vanilla JS

### Next Steps:
* Batter and pitcher selection is buggy, should probably use Angular for true data binding.
* Add summary statistics.
* Plotly plots are clean but sparse, could use D3 to create better plots.
* Use a real database/back-end, Algolia is great but expensive with larger datasets.
* Add data from MLB AM API (handedness data).
* Synchronize plots.
